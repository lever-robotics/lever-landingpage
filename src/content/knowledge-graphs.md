The knowledge graph is a relationship graph that relates all the information business.

## Key Components

### Subject
An entity in your business system such as a Customer, Product, or Employee.

### Object
An entity in your business system that can be related to a subject such as a Transaction, Email, or Calendar Event.

### Predicate

    object: "Product"
};
```
